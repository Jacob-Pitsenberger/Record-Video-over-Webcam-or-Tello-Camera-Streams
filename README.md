# Webcam Video Recorder Module

This module provides a convenient way to record video from an internal or external webcam using OpenCV in Python.

## Prerequisites
- Python
- OpenCV (cv2)
- datetime
- os

## Usage

### Recording Video
```python
from video_recorder import record_over_webcam

# Record video from the default internal camera (channel 0)
record_over_webcam(0)
```

#### Function Parameters
channel (int): The channel number of the camera to record from.

## How it Works

1. The module uses OpenCV for video processing, datetime for timestamping, and os for file operations.

2. It creates a directory named 'recordings' within the current working directory to save the recorded videos.

3. The `record_over_webcam` function records video over the specified webcam feed and saves it for later viewing. It takes the camera channel number as an argument.

4. The recorded video is saved in the 'recordings' directory with a unique timestamped filename.

5. The `stream_video` function reads frames from the capture object, writes them to a file using the writer object, and displays them for viewing until the 'q' key is pressed.

6. After recording is complete, it releases the video capture, writer, and destroys the display window.

## Running the Example
To run the example, simply call the `record_over_webcam` function with the desired camera channel as an argument.

```python
record_over_webcam(0)
```
